            <p class="p1">"Mobile App Experience (MAX) is becoming the digital center of customer experience, and mobile apps are becoming the preferred destination where the exchange of value between customers and brands is most respected and rewarded. Yet, some brands treat their mobile apps as just another promotional channel. They’re driving customers to the app, but not holding onto them.&nbsp;"</p>
            <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="p2">"The truth is, holding onto customers is hard. It calls for in-app experiences tailored to the individual, so you can build loyalty and generate revenue. Done well, everyone wins.</p>
